#12/02.1: Initial configuration.

.1.Asked for a excercise to CHATGPT and it gave me this:

Sure! Here is a simple project idea in Python:

"Guess the Number" game

In this game, the computer randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and
the player has to guess what the number is. The computer gives hints whether the player's
guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the
number.

Here's some sample code to get you started:



import random

print("Welcome to the Guess the Number game!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
print("Try to guess what it is in as few attempts as possible.\n")

# Set the secret number
number = random.randint(1, 100)

# Initialize variables to keep track of the number of guesses and whether the player has won
guesses = 0
won = False

# Start the game loop
while not won:
    # Get the player's guess
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
    
    # Update the number of guesses
    guesses += 1
    
    # Check if the guess is too high or too low
    if guess > number:
        print("Too high! Try again.")
    elif guess < number:
        print("Too low! Try again.")
    else:
        # The player has won!
        won = True
        
# Print the final message
if won:
    print(f"\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in {guesses} attempts.")



#12/02.2 CHECK POINT 
#13/02.1> My steps.

After understanding the excercise (next time I'll ask for no tricks) I will create
the game as well.
